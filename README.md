## Problem Statement

One-third of all food globally is wasted, with the UK discarding 9.52 million tonnes annually—70% from households. This waste could feed 30 million people, yet 8.4 million face food poverty, costing households £470 yearly. Our app helps reduce waste by keeping users informed on when their food will expire which also has the benefit of preventing users over-buying, thus reducing food waste.

“Waste less, taste more!”
