## Problem Statement

One-third of all food globally is wasted, with the UK discarding 9.52 million tonnes annually—70% from households. This waste could feed 30 million people, yet 8.4 million face food poverty, costing households £470 yearly.

 **Backend:** Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL

**Authentication:** Clerk

**Testing:** Vitest (unit testing), Playwright (end-to-end testing)

**Deployment:** Netlify (Frontend), Supabase (Backend)

## Challenges & Learnings

- What did you and your team struggle with?
- What skills did you improve?

Example:

> Key Takeaways:
> 
> - Implementing **real-time chat** using Firebase was a challenge due to security concerns, but we learned about Firestore rules.
> - Managing **user roles (landlords vs. tenants)** in the database helped us understand relational data modelling.
